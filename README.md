# About the Buy'N'Drive
This is the project for practice, where i try working with SQL queries and SQLite database.
The project imitates car auction with such specifications, as:
* Condition(New or Used)
* Saloon(Coupe, Hatchback, Sedan)
* Color(White, Black, etc.)
* Car(Any car you want)

## Textures
All of the textures were created on Photoshop by myself, except of car`s photos.
